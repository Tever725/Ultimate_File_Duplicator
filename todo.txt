TODOs:

1. Upload current ver. to github w/ gnu3 and readme

2. If multiple files in input, ask user if they either want to copy:
    a. All files in 1 mod folder.
        or
    b. Each file in separate mod folders.

3. Allow user to choose which slots to copy.

4. Functionality for more than 8 slots for each character.

5. Possibly implement a GUI?

6. Allow user to exclude certain characters
